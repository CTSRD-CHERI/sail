Sail model of CHERI-MIPS ISA
============================

This repository contains a model of the CHERI-MIPS ISA in the [Sail
language](https://github.com/rems-project/sail). Sail can build an ISA
simulator, convert to theorem prover input or generate latex for
inclusion in the CHERI ISA manual.

Sail via OPAM
=============

We recommend to install the Sail compiler using the opam package. See
the following [wiki page](https://github.com/rems-project/sail/wiki/OPAMInstall).
